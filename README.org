  :PROPERTIES:
  :noweb:    yes
  :END:
A set of basic =rebar3= templates for LFE applications.

** Setup
#+BEGIN_SRC makefile :exports none :tangle Makefile
# -*- mode: makefile; tab-width: 2 -*-

templates   := $(wildcard lfe-*)
destination := $(HOME)/.config/rebar3/templates

install:
	@cp -r $(templates) $(destination)

uninstall:
	@rm -rf $(foreach template, $(templates), $(destination)/$(template))
#+END_SRC

Make sure you have [[https://www.rebar3.org/v3.0/docs#installing-binary][=rebar3= installed]] then run:
#+BEGIN_SRC fish
make install
#+END_SRC
to copy the templates to =$HOME/.config/rebar3/templates=.

** Use
There are three templates:
- [[file:lfe-app][=lfe-app=]]
- [[file:lfe-lib][=lfe-lib=]]
- [[file:lfe-release][=lfe-release=]]
- [[file:lfe-unit-test][=lfe-unit-test=]]

They all mimic the [[https://github.com/rebar/rebar3/tree/master/priv/templates][default rebar3 templates]].
#+BEGIN_SRC fish
rebar3 new lfe-app name=my-new-app
cd my-new-app
rebar3 compile
#+END_SRC
